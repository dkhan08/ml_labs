Machine Learning Lab

Lab Overview

Lab 1: Cost Function
Objective: Explore the cost function for linear regression.
Description: Learn about Mean Squared Error (MSE) and its role in evaluating model performance.

Lab 2: Linear Regression
Objective: Build a linear regression model from scratch.
Description: Covers hypothesis functions, gradient descent, and parameter estimation.

Lab 3: Logistic & Multiclass Logistic Regression
Objective: Implement logistic regression for binary and multiclass classification.
Description:
Part 1: Binary logistic regression.
Part 2: Multiclass classification using the one-vs-all approach.

Lab 4: Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Objective: Apply SVM to regression and classification.
Description:
Part 1: Support Vector Regression (SVR).
Part 2: Support Vector Classification (SVC) with linear and non-linear kernels.

Lab 5: Decision Trees
Objective: Implement decision trees for classification.
Description: Focus on tree models, pruning, and evaluation.
